## Compare Wizard

Use the __Compare__ wizard to:

* Examine the permission settings in relation to another SharePoint object.
* Find out which permissions should be given/taken to the preferred SharePoint object users in compare to another similar SharePoint object.
* Compare SharePoint object permissions for the entire history by selecting the same SharePoint object for a different time period.

## Instructions

1. Click the __Compare__ option. The following Compare options are available:
   *  __Compare to Parent__ – available for sites with broken permissions only. Choose this option to compare differences between the selected securable object and its parent.
    * __Compare to Previous__ – available when there are previous permission records for the selected securable object. Explore how permissions for a selected securable object have changed over time.

2. Choose a certain permission record by the date you want to compare from the dropdown menu. Select a site collection, then drill down to the site, subsite, list and list item. Do this on both sides to compare the permissions for selected objects.

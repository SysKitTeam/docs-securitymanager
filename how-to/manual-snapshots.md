# Take Manual Snapshots

1. Click the **Take Snapshot** button and then **choose preferred snapshot option**:
   * **Automatic Discovery** – This option creates a full snapshot of your environment. SysKit Security Manager will automatically detect and load data from new site collections. Note, this can take a while.
   * **Custom** – This is the default option that gives you the possibility to manage site collections included in the snapshot. This option will not load new site collections.
2. Click **Take Snapshot**. SysKit Security Manager will start gathering snapshot data in the background. You can track the progress on the status bar at the bottom of the screen.

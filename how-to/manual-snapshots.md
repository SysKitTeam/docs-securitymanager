# Take Manual Snapshots

1. Click the **Take Snapshot** button and then **choose preferred snapshot option**:
   * **Discover & Load Everything** – This option creates a full snapshot of your environment. SysKit Security Manager will automatically detect and load data from new site collections, Office 365 Groups& Microsoft Teams and personal OneDrive accounts. This may take a while.
   * **Custom** – This option gives you the ability to choose site collections, Office 365 Groups&Microsoft Teams and personal OneDrive accounts for snapshot. This option will not run the discovery process of your environment.
2. Click **Take Snapshot**. SysKit Security Manager will start gathering snapshot data in the background. You can track the progress on the status bar at the bottom of the screen.

# Customize Audit Logs Collection

By default, **SysKit Security Manager collects the majority of available activities**, nevertheless, you have the option to select which activities are being collected.

To see all available activities and manage which of them are collected by SysKit Security Manager, navigate to **Settings** &gt; **Audit** &gt; **Audit Logs**, and click the **Select activities to collect** link. A new window opens, giving you the possibility to **select or deselect** **an activity, or an entire activity group,** for collection.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Tip!**

**To save disk space** used by audit logs data, disable the collection of activities that you consider unnecessary.

**Can't find an activity** in the audit reports? Chances are, it is not collected by default. Review your settings and turn on the collection of wanted activities.
{% endhint %}

Below, you can find a **complete list of audit log activity categories available in SysKit Security Manager.** You can select from **more than 200 activities** currently available, with **the list being regularly updated** with new activities. By clicking on the activity category link, you can find the following information for each activity in the selected category:

* **Display Name** - activity name visible in SysKit Security Manager
* **Original Name** - original activity name created by Microsoft visible in Audit logs search
* **Description** - short description of every activity
* **Collected** - column showing if the activity is collected by default

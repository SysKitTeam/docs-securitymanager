We have provided you with an overview of the entire application and how to use it. For detailed information on particular features, please explore our other articles.

## Let's get started

After successfully activating the application, or starting the trial, you will be able to connect to SharePoint Online or On-Premise site collection using your SharePoint admin credentials.

You can also use your credentials to connect to Office 365 Groups.

Afterwards, on the **Site Collections** screen, you can see the site structure and explore and manage the permissions of the site collections you connected. On the **Office 365 Groups** screen, you can see an overview of all connected Office 365 Groups: their settings, owners and members.

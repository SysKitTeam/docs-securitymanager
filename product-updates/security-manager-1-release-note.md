## Items with Unique Permissions

Detection of unique permissions at the item level and deep nested SharePoint structure can be a challenging task. This report helps you find out folders and files which have unique permissions. **Drill to Report** action enables you to list all permissions of the items with broken inheritance.

## External Users & Anonymous Access Links

If your site collection is enabled for sharing with external users or sharing by using anonymous access links is allowed, these two reports can help you increase data security and compliance.

* **External Users on Site Collection** – Shows all of the external users that have accessed your site collection.
* **Anonymous Access Links** – Lists all the items that are shared to anonymous users with anonymous access links.

## Access Requests

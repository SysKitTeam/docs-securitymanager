## Bug Fixes
* When attempting to connect to site collection using subsite URL, SysKit Security Manager displayed the following error: https://syskit.sharepoint.com/marketing/' is not a valid site collection or is not accessible.
To avoid this error we improved validation of site collection links. Now you can connect to your site collection using subsite links or any URL that includes a valid site collection URL.

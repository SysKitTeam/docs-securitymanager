# Snapshots Screen

This screen will display all the [snapshots](basics.md#snapshot) of your environment created using SysKit Security Manager.

The **Load Duration** column displays how long it took to take a snapshot of your environment.

The **Type of Snapshot** column shows whether a snapshot was taken with the Custom or Auto discovery option. The **Custom** snapshot option gives you the ability to manage site collections for snapshots. This option will not load new site collections, only existing ones. The **Automatic Discovery** option allows you to create a full snapshot of your environment. SysKit Security Manager will automatically detect and load from new site collections in SharePoint.

You’ll be able to see the number of loaded SharePoint sites, Office 365 groups, Microsoft Teams, and personal OneDrive accounts in each snapshot.

The following actions are available:

* **Take Snapshot** – Take a manual snapshot of your environment.
* **Open Snapshot** – Open the currently selected snapshot.
* **Delete Snapshot** – Delete the currently selected snapshot.
* **Snapshot Schedule** - Take a snapshot automatically, at the time you specified.

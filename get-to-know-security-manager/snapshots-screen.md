This screen will display all the [snapshots](#internal/get-to-know-security-manager/basics.md#snapshot) of your environment created using SysKit Security Manager.

The __Load Duration__ column displays how long it took to take a snapshot of your environment.

The __Type of Snapshot__ column shows whether a snapshot was taken with the Custom or Auto discovery option. The __Custom__ snapshot option gives you the ability to manage site collections for snapshots. This option will not load new site collections, only existing ones.
The __Automatic Discovery__ option allows you to create a full snapshot of your environment. SysKit Security Manager will automatically detect and load from new site collections in SharePoint.

You’ll be able to see the number of loaded SharePoint sites, Office 365 groups, Microsoft Teams, and personal OneDrive accounts in each snapshot.

The following actions are available:

* __Take Snapshot__ – Take a manual snapshot of your environment.
* __Open Snapshot__ – Open the currently selected snapshot.
* __Delete Snapshot__ – Delete the currently selected snapshot.

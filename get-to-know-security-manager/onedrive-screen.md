The OneDrive screen gives you a general overview of your connected personal OneDrive accounts, as well as a report for each OneDrive account.

### Available actions 
* __Disconnect OneDrive__ – This action will remove permissions in Office 365 and connections in SysKit Security Manager so you will no longer be the owner of any OneDrive in the selected tenant.
* __Stop Sharing__ – Remove all unique permissions from the selected OneDrive. This will disable all anonymous links as well.

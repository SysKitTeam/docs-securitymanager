To install **SysKit Security Manager** and to successfully manage SharePoint permissions, Office 365 Groups and more, you need to have the following privileges:

* **Local Administrator** on the target installation computer
* **Site Collection Administrator** on the desired SharePoint Online or SharePoint On-Premises environment

In order to fully utilize management options of SysKit Security Manager for Office 365 Groups you need to be given [consent by a Global SharePoint Online Administrator](user-permissions-requirements.md#internal/requirements/global-admin-consent).

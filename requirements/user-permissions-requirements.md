To install __SysKit Security Manager__ and to successfully manage SharePoint permissions, Office 365 Groups and more, you need to have the following privileges:
* __Local Administrator__ on the target installation computer
* __Site Collection Administrator__ on the desired SharePoint Online or SharePoint On-Premises environment

In order to fully utilize management options of SysKit Security Manager for Office 365 Groups you need to be given [consent by a Global SharePoint Online Administrator](#internal/requirements/global-admin-consent).

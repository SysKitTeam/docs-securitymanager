# Install SysKit Security Manager

## Installation Steps

1. [Download](https://www.syskit.com/products/security-manager/download) application.
2. Unpack and run **SysKitSecurityManagerSetup.exe**. The wizard will guide you through the installation steps, click **Next &gt;** to proceed. 
3. Click **I Accept the terms of the license agreement** to accept the license and then click **Next** &gt; to proceed.
4. Select a setup type:  **Default** or **Advanced**. With the default installation type no additional configuration is required.
5. Choose the installation folder e.g. **C:\Program Files\SysKit\Security Manager.** Click **Next** &gt; to proceed.
6. The installation wizard will unpack your files and you will be able to run the application from: **Start** &gt; **All Programs** &gt; **SysKit Security Manager**. 

### Advanced Installation

Installs the **SysKit Security Manager Service** which allows you to take scheduled snapshots while the application is not running. Requires a **dedicated SQL Server database** and a [Service Account](https://github.com/SysKitTeam/docs-securitymanager/tree/7a41ecf00806ae7d8f47809e3c4d6fedecb7bd0c/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/service-accounts/README.md). A service account is a user account that is created explicitly to provide a security context for services running on Windows Server operating systems. The security context determined the serviceâ€™s ability to access local and network resources. The Windows operating systems rely on services to run various features. These services can be configured through the applications, the Services snap-in, or Task Manager, or by using Windows PowerShell.

**SysKit Security Manager Configuration Wizard** will automatically start when you start SysKit Security Manage for the first time. Alternatively, you can start it manually by running it from the installation folder \(default is C:\ProgramFiles\SysKit\Security Manager\Host\SysKit.SecurityManager.ConfigurationWizard.exe\). Follow the steps [here ](../configuration.md)to successfully configure the application.

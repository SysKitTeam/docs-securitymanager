### Advanced Installation

Installs the **SysKit Security Manager Service** which allows you to take scheduled snapshots while the application is not running. Requires a **dedicated SQL Server database** and a [Service Account](%20https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/service-accounts).  A service account is a user account that is created explicitly to provide a security context for services running on Windows Server operating systems. The security context determined the serviceâ€™s ability to access local and network resources. The Windows operating systems rely on services to run various features. These services can be configured through the applications, the Services snap-in, or Task Manager, or by using Windows PowerShell.  

**SysKit Security Manager Configuration Wizard** will automatically start when you start SysKit Security Manage for the first time. Alternatively, you can start it manually by running it from the installation folder \(default is C:\ProgramFiles\SysKit\Security Manager\Host\SysKit.SecurityManager.ConfigurationWizard.exe\). Follow the steps [here ](../configuration.md)to successfully configure the application.

### What does SysKit do with the information sent during the product activation process?

We use the information only to verify that your product is used within the scope allowed by the SysKit End-User License Agreement \(EULA\).

If you register your product, none of the activation information will ever be linked to your personal customer information.

No. Activation is a secure and anonymous one-time process.

The activation technology in the product does not send any additional information to SysKit.

Product activation is a one-time process that is typically completed immediately after installation of the software. Activation typically takes 2-5 seconds to complete.
